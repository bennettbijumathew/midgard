## Description
Midgard was a team project for university where it involved creating a database system that allows archers to track and view their scores. The database is created using MySQL while the website uses PHP to connect the database to the website. 
In this repository, you will be able to see the final version of the database along with a website created for inserting new scores based on the inputted rounds and archers. 

## Database Design
The design of the database went through multiple stages, these stages involved understanding the client's requirements, create a inital design and refining and reshaping it to the final product. With this database, the approach was to use a third normal form structure where each record that is connected to its own table. This approach ensures that a column within a record is not redundant and is consistent across the board. The Entity Relationship is shown below, where the relationship between tables are shown.
